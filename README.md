This is a puzzle game in which you need to switch between several different planes of existance in order to complete the puzzle. 
Use the number keys to switch between the different planes of existance. There are eight different planes of existance that the designer of a level could use, however usually only 2-5 are generally used.
The arrow keys will move the character.
The + and - keys will switch between levels. When game will keep track of your progress, and you cannot complete levels until you complete the ones before them.

To launch the game, you'll need to have ruby installed, and you'll need to install gosu:
$ gem install gosu
Then launch Switch.rb
$ ruby Switch.rb
OR you could just launch the Switch.exe file by double clicking it.

If you want to design your own levels, you will need ruby and gosu though. Just launch LevelEditor.rb
$ ruby LevelEditor.rb

When creating levels, click to add platforms. Press 0 to add black blocks. Black blocks will be there no matter which plane of existance the user has selected, and the black platform farthest down left will act as a spawn point. Press 9 to add white blocks. These will be there no matter which plane of existance the user has selected, and will also act as a finish line, or the end of the level.

If you design some great levels, feel free to send them to me and have them included in the game and your name will be added to the following list of level designers.
